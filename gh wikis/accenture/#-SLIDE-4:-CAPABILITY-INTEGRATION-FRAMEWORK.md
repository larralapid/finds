## Slide Title:
"Integrated Capability Model: Driving Synergistic Value"

## Core Content:

### Capability Integration Model
(Visual: Circular/interconnected framework showing how capabilities support each other)

1. Core Value Drivers
- Cultural Synergies → Innovation Accelerator
- Ways of Working → Engineering Practices
- Knowledge Management → Performance Management
- Change Management (overlays all capabilities)

2. Integration Principles
- People-Process-Technology Alignment
- Cross-Capability Workflows
- Unified Governance Model
- Integrated Value Streams

### Key Synergy Points

1. Cultural + Innovation
- Cross-border ideation
- Global innovation networks
- Cultural diversity driving creativity
- Unified innovation practices

2. Ways of Working + Engineering
- Standardized development practices
- Integrated delivery pipelines
- Common quality standards
- Automated workflows

3. Knowledge + Performance
- Data-driven decision making
- Performance insights sharing
- Best practice adoption
- Continuous learning loops

### Value Multipliers

1. Cross-Capability Benefits
- Accelerated adoption through cultural alignment
- Enhanced innovation through knowledge sharing
- Improved performance through standardized practices
- Reduced risks through integrated governance

2. Scaling Effects
- Network effect across capabilities
- Compound improvement impacts
- Exponential value creation
- Sustainable growth model

## Additional Context:
- Framework shows how capabilities work together rather than in isolation
- Emphasizes compounding benefits of integrated approach
- Demonstrates value multiplication through capability interaction
- Supports both tactical and strategic objectives

## Key Considerations:
- Must be easily understood by different stakeholders
- Should show clear value creation paths
- Need to demonstrate practical integration
- Must support phased implementation

## Integration Points:
- Links to individual capability models
- Supports implementation roadmap
- Enables governance framework
- Drives transformation approach

## Visual Elements Needed:
1. Capability Integration Diagram
   - Interactive/layered view
   - Clear connection points
   - Value flow indicators
   
2. Synergy Matrix
   - Capability intersections
   - Value creation points
   - Integration opportunities

3. Value Multiplication Model
   - Compound benefits
   - Scaling effects
   - ROI acceleration

## Supporting Tools:
1. Capability Integration Assessment
2. Synergy Mapping Template
3. Value Multiplication Calculator
4. Integration Readiness Checklist
