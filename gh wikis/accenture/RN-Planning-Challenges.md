That's a good agenda structure that will help facilitate an open discussion to understand different perspectives before proposing solutions. Let me help build out key points to explore under each agenda item based on the documentation:

**1. Leadership Ask for RN Release Planning**
- Need clear delivery commitments and dates for upcoming releases
- Want timeline visibility across the RN roadmap
- Expecting delivery predictability after recent organizational changes
- Looking for confidence in team's ability to deliver strategic priorities

**2. Conversation with Engineering So Far**
- Engineering requesting detailed user stories upfront for full release
- Expressing discomfort with committing without complete scope clarity 
- Concerned about potential scope changes after commitment
- Wanting better understanding of dependencies and technical complexity early

**3. Engineering Challenges & Product Management Response**
Engineering Challenges:
- Difficulty in providing confident estimates without detailed requirements
- Fear of being held to dates while scope evolves
- Limited early technical input into feature planning
- Resource allocation across multiple releases (1.4, 1.4.1, 1.5)

Product Management Response:
- Working to provide detailed stories but concerned about agility impact
- Want to maintain flexibility to adapt to changing needs
- See detailed upfront requirements as waterfall-like approach
- Trying to balance leadership needs with engineering concerns

**4. Potential Root Causes**
- Lack of structured release planning process
- No clear capacity understanding or guardrails
- Limited early collaboration between product and engineering
- Trust gap between teams due to past delivery challenges
- Missing technical product management role to bridge gaps
- Pressure from stakeholders creating downstream tension

**5. Way Forward**
Propose collaborative approach:
- Implement progressive elaboration in planning
- Start with high-level feature sizing before detailed stories
- Create joint planning forums for early technical input
- Establish capacity guardrails upfront
- Build in regular checkpoints to assess and adjust
- Define clear change management process
- Consider pilot with upcoming 1.6 release

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or suggest specific discussion prompts for each agenda item?
