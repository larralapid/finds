- Insufficient early technical input
- Challenges with capacity planning across teams
- Difficulty balancing new features vs technical debt

3. Release Management:
- UAT process needs improvement
- Defect management process not standardized
- Regression testing coverage concerns

**Current Team Structure**
- 3 Product Managers
- 4 Product Owners (1 leaving in December)
- ~90 people in engineering/QA
- Distributed team across US, Europe, India, Philippines
- Significant time zone challenges impacting collaboration

**Achievements**
