### End-to-End Process Maps

1. Core Delivery Processes
   - Program & Project Management
     * Planning
     * Execution
     * Monitoring
     * Control
   
   - Development Lifecycle
     * Requirements
     * Design
     * Build
     * Test
     * Deploy
   
   - Operations Management
     * Service Delivery
     * Support
     * Maintenance
     * Enhancement

2. Support Processes
   - Quality Management
   - Risk Management
   - Knowledge Management
   - Resource Management

### Integration Points

1. Cross-Capability Integration
   - Cultural Synergies ↔ Ways of Working
   - Engineering Practices ↔ Performance Management
   - Innovation ↔ Knowledge Management
   - Change Management (overlays all)

2. Tool Integration
