# Operating Model Architect Competency Assessment
## Level: 1 - Customer Experience Domain

### Assessment Questions and Explanations

#### Question 1: Value Stream & Strategy
**Question:**  
Which component is MOST critical when defining value streams in a customer experience context?

**Options:**  
a) Internal process efficiency  
b) End-to-end customer journey touchpoints  
c) Department structure alignment  
d) Technology system mapping  

**Correct Answer:** b) End-to-end customer journey touchpoints

### Assessment Questions and Explanations (Continued)

#### Question 6: Measurement Framework
**Question:**

**Explanation:**  
Customer satisfaction and value delivery metrics are the most critical measures as they directly indicate whether the operating model is achieving its primary purpose - delivering value to customers.

**Correct Answer:** b) Understanding current customer pain points

**Explanation:**  
Beginning with a thorough understanding of customer pain points is essential because it ensures that any transformation efforts are directed at solving real customer problems. Starting with technology, restructuring, or process changes without first understanding customer needs risks implementing solutions that don't address core customer issues. This customer-first approach aligns with best practices in experience-driven transformation.

**Correct Answer:** c) Ensuring consistent experience delivery across channels

**Explanation:**  
Governance in customer experience focuses on maintaining consistency across all channels and touchpoints. This is crucial because customers expect a seamless experience regardless of how they interact with the organization. While service rules, complaint management, and documentation are important, they are components of the broader goal of delivering consistent experiences that meet customer expectations across all channels.

**Correct Answer:** b) By enabling seamless customer journeys

**Explanation:**  
Technology strategy should primarily focus on enabling seamless customer journeys rather than pursuing technology for its own sake. While cost reduction and standardization are important, and staying current with trends can be beneficial, these should be secondary to ensuring technology effectively supports and enhances the customer experience. The technology strategy must align with and enable the desired customer journey.

This ensures that customers perceive and receive services as part of a unified experience rather than as disconnected offerings.
