Let me start with Step 1: Defining Implementation Assets and Enabling Assets.

# ASSET DEFINITIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS

## Implementation Assets
Definition: Concrete, actionable tools, templates, and frameworks that are directly used to execute specific aspects of the Borderless Delivery Model implementation.

Characteristics:
- Highly structured and standardized
- Ready-to-use with minimal customization
- Contains clear instructions and usage guidelines
- Includes validation checkpoints and success criteria
- Produces measurable outputs
- Directly supports implementation activities

Examples:
- Assessment templates
- Implementation checklists
- RACI matrices
- Configuration guides
- Scoring frameworks
- Workflow templates

## Enabling Assets
Definition: Supporting materials, guides, and resources that provide context, best practices, and methodological guidance to effectively use Implementation Assets.

Characteristics:
- Educational and explanatory in nature
- Provides context and background
- Includes best practices and lessons learned
- Offers flexibility in application
- Focuses on knowledge transfer
- Supports decision-making

Examples:
- Best practice guides
- Training materials
- Decision frameworks
- Case studies
- Reference architectures
- Implementation playbooks

## Key Differences
1. Usage:
   - Implementation Assets: Direct execution
   - Enabling Assets: Guidance and support

2. Structure:
   - Implementation Assets: Highly structured, standardized
   - Enabling Assets: More flexible, contextual

3. Output:
   - Implementation Assets: Specific deliverables
   - Enabling Assets: Knowledge and capability

4. Customization:
   - Implementation Assets: Minimal customization needed
   - Enabling Assets: Adaptable to different contexts
