# RN1.4 UAT Progress Review and Decision Making Meeting Report
Date: December 2024
Focus: Release 1.4 Defect Review & Engineering Alignment

## Context
Key stakeholders from Product Management and Engineering teams met to review UAT defects and align on release readiness criteria for Release 1.4. The meeting focused on defect classification, regression testing status, and critical performance issues.

## Key Status Updates

### Defect Status
- Total UAT defects: 94
- Active/New defects requiring attention: 55
- Current breakdown:
  - Critical: 3 (2 new)
  - High: 6 (3 new)
  - Medium: 81 (33 active)
- Additional ~20 defects pending logging from Product team

### Testing Progress
- PM testing phase completed
- Customer Success testing scheduled for Thursday/Friday
- Regression testing ongoing by engineering team
- Performance issues identified in location validation functionality

## Critical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Defect Classification
Challenge: Inconsistent defect categorization and lack of shared criteria
Solution: 
- Engineering to share formal defect classification criteria
- PM team to review/reclassify defects within next 2 hours
- Focus on validating medium priority defects first

### 2. Performance Issues
Challenge: Timeout issues with location validation during data upload
Solutions proposed:
1. Primary: Disable location field editing in templates
2. Backup: Implement user training on proper template usage
3. Future: Consider database/template redesign in Release 1.5

## Action Items

### Immediate (Next 2 Hours)
1. Engineering team:
   - Share defect classification criteria
   - Document location validation solution in ADO
   - Assess feasibility of disabling template editing

2. Product team:
   - Complete logging of remaining ~20 defects
   - Review/reclassify existing defects using shared criteria
   - Validate critical/high priority classifications

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Thursday/Friday:
   - Conduct Customer Success testing
   - Complete regression testing validation
   - Review updated defect status

2. Documentation:
   - Document key decisions via email for traceability
   - Update ADO with latest classification decisions

## Next Steps
- Follow-up meeting scheduled for tomorrow
- Reclassification results to drive next phase of work
- Engineering team to assess fix timeline based on final classifications

## Additional Notes
- Agreement to maintain both chat and email communication for key decisions
- Need for proper documentation highlighted due to team transitions
- Focus on critical/high priority issues for immediate attention

This report reflects the current status and next steps agreed upon during the meeting. Success of Release 1.4 depends on swift completion of the agreed actions and clear communication across teams.
