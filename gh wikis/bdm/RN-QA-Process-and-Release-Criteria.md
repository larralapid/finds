Let me propose a pragmatic release criteria framework based on industry practices while considering RN's current context:

### Proposed Release Exit Criteria

1. Must Fix (Release Blockers)
```
- All Severity 1 (Critical) defects regardless of priority
- All Severity 2 (High) defects with Priority 1 or 2
- Any Severity 3 defects with Priority 1
```

2. Should Fix (Release Goals)
```
- Severity 2 defects with Priority 3
- Severity 3 defects with Priority 2
- Any defect impacting core user flows
```

3. Accept with Sign-off
```
- Severity 3 defects with Priority 3 or 4
- Known issues with documented workarounds
- Performance issues within acceptable thresholds
```

4. Defer to Next Release
```
- All Severity 4 (Low) defects
- Cosmetic issues
- Enhancement requests
```

### Additional Release Quality Gates

1. Core Functionality
```
- All primary user journeys tested & working
- Critical integrations validated
- Data integrity verified
```

2. Production Readiness
```
- No deployment blockers
- Environment configuration validated
- Database/data migration scripts tested
```

3. Business Sign-off
```
- UAT completed with stakeholders
- Known issues documented & accepted
- Support team ready for deployment
```

### Industry Best Practices Context

1. Risk-Based Approach
- Most organizations don't require 100% defect-free releases
- Focus on business impact over technical severity
- Accept some known issues with clear mitigation plans

2. Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Zero defect policies (often leads to hiding issues)
- Purely severity-based criteria (ignores business context)
- No documented exceptions process

3. Key Success Factors
- Clear ownership of release decisions
- Documented exception process
- Transparent tracking of known issues
- Regular stakeholder communication

Would you like me to elaborate on implementation details or provide specific examples of how this would work in practice?
