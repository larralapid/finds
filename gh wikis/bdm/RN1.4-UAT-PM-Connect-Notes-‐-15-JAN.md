## Executive Summary
The meeting focused on critical defect management and release readiness for Release 1.4, revealing significant challenges with defect tracking, categorization, and cross-team coordination. A substantial number of new defects were logged in the past 24 hours, requiring immediate attention and process alignment.

## Key Updates & Status

### Defect Status
- Total active defects: ~74 (across multiple tracking boards)
- New defects logged yesterday: ~40
- Critical/High/Medium defects targeted for resolution by next day
- Approximately 20 additional defects pending logging from Pablo's review
- Current regression testing completion: ~50%

### Documentation & Tracking Challenges
1. Multiple tracking systems in place:
   - UAT defect board (~94 UAT defects)
   - Main release board (~74 active defects)
   - Separate regression testing spreadsheet (limited access)

2. Process Issues:
   - Unclear/Inconsistent defect categorization criteria
   - Duplicate defects potentially present
   - Unclear ownership of defect triage
   - Communication gaps between QA and Product teams

## Critical Decisions & Actions

### Immediate Actions (Next 24 Hours)
1. Product Team:
   - Yanick to log ~20 pending defects from Pablo's review - DONE
   - Ben/Yanick to review defect categorization and priorities
   - Remove PO tags from resolved items
   - Team members to check emails and respond to pending comments

2. QA Team Needs To:
   - Remove duplicate defects
   - Share formal categorization criteria
   - Clarify regression testing status and plan

### Process Improvements
1. Documentation:
   - Consolidate tracking to the single dashboard view
   - Implement clear severity criteria:
     - Critical: Data and insights/upload related
     - High: Wrong UX implementation
     - Medium: Existing workaround but annoying
     - Low: UI alignment issues

2. Communication:
   - Establish daily status updates
   - Use one centralized dashboard for discussions
   - Improve cross-team visibility

## Risk Areas

1. Release Timeline:
   - Significant number of open defects
   - Regression testing is only 50% complete

## Next Steps

1. Engineering Meeting Preparation:
   - Present complete defect count and status
   - Discuss the feasibility of closing Critical/High/Medium defects by tomorrow
   - Align on regression testing completion criteria

2. Process Implementation:
   - Establish a single source of truth for defect tracking
   - Implement clear categorization criteria
   - Set up daily status review cadence
